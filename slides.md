## Key Features Overview

- **New Endpoint**: `/users/profile` for aggregated user data.
- **Enhanced Security**: OAuth 2.0 is now mandatory.
- **Batch Operations**: Support for bulk record creation.

## Performance Improvements

We have optimized our core sorting algorithm. The new implementation reduces the time complexity for average cases.

The previous version had a complexity of:
$$ O(n^2) $$

The new version improves this to:
$$ O(n \log n) $$

This results in a significant performance gain on large datasets.

## Migration from v1.0

<div class="quote">
  "The migration process is designed to be as seamless as possible."
</div>

**Key Steps:**
1.  Update base URL to `https://api.example.com/v2/`.
2.  Replace API key authentication with an OAuth 2.0 token.
3.  Test deprecated endpoints and update to their v2.0 equivalents.
